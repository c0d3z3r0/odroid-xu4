# odroid-xu4

This repository contains u-boot, hardkernels binary blobs and the linux kernel with its modules for the Odroid-XU4.

All the binaries except those in `blobs` have been built by myself. You can find the config files in `config`.
The kernel config was originally based on Debian's armhf config.
